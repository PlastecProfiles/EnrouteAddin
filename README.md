Please watch and fork and create pull request as much as you like.
If anyone has any question about how this code please open an issue and ask!

To do:
1. Experiment with nesting.
2. I am working on trying to get it to select only   a specific dia hole 
3 Possibly make it so that a person can record a "macro" if nessecary it could simply provide code that could be put in to visual studio.
4 Clean up the code. I have been so excited about being able to make these that I didn't focus on keeping code topnotch.
5. Possibly make a recovery program
